A very new project starts today hoping that it will become something very useful in future.

Just finished a properly working callable function for multiple platforms for python shell~ Hope this will go good
The module 'clear()' inside the clr package can be used to clear python shell on 'Windows/Linux/MacOS' based platforms and can be called using either 'from clr import clear' or ' import clr'. In first case use 'clear()' whenever needed to be cleaned and in second use 'clr.clear()' (basic pyhton calling and using of modules).
Thank you.

Added a new file named myc.py (Short for MySQL_Connection.py), this can be used to quickly connect to mysql server from python shell.
Note: This package have several modules, one of it is an executable function 'exec', it can be called using 'from myc import exec' and to call the cursor object use 'from myc import mycrsr'. Alternatively you can import whole package then use these modules with package name.Thanks!
