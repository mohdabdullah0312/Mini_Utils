## 🧩 Scripts Overview

- **`clr.py`**  
  Clears the console/terminal screen using a system-specific command.

- **`myc.py`**  
  A personal custom made python script to connect python with mysql user easily by just providing key details.

- **`starting_func_call/start.py`**  
  Just a personal tool I used to run on each startup to update in a single go.

- **`toss/toss.py`**  
  Simulates a coin toss using Python's `random` module for basic probability testing.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Standard Libraries:
  - `os`
  - `random`
  - `subprocess` (if used)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohdabdullah0312/Mini_Utils.git
cd Mini_Utils
```

Run any script individually:

```bash
python clr.py
python toss/toss.py
```

## 📌 Notes

- This repository is experimental and contains small, isolated scripts.
- Mainly built for self-use, testing concepts, and improving fluency in scripting.
