Just finished a properly working callable function for multiple platforms for python shell~ Hope this will go good
The module 'clear()' inside the clr package can be used to clear python shell on 'Windows/Linux/MacOS' based platforms and can be called using either 'from clr import clear' or ' import clr'. In first case use 'clear()' whenever needed to be cleaned and in second use 'clr.clear()' (basic pyhton calling and using of modules).
Thank you.
